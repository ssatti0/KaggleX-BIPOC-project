# KaggleX-BIPOC-project
This project is a result of my participation in KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Program. 
During this program, I had the opportunity to take courses, attend talks, and work on a project that interests me. I chose to work on image classification. The dataset, from Kaggle, contains over 4500 images of healthy and diseased plants from 12 different types. Using both MobilenetV2 and VGG16 pre-trained models as a base, a classifier with 22 classes was attached as a head. Accuracies of 88% and 89% were achieved, respectively.
